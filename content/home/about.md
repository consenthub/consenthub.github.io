__CONSENT__HUB is the centre of the consent research community and a key point of contact for policymakers. We connect academics and policymakers working on consent and the way consent is communicated. We organise and publicise research activities, foster collaboration, inspire new researchers to enter the field, and provide early-career researchers with opportunities.
